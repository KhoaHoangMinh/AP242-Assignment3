1. It is not allowed to use any additional modules other than the ones already provided. <br>
2. The studentâ€™s program must consist solely of functions defined using the def keyword, without
the use of global variables or custom data types (i.e., no class declarations). <br>
3. The use of loops such as for, while, etc., is prohibited. Instead, students must use higher-order
functions and list comprehensions. <br>
4. Within each function body, students may declare variables, but each variable must be assigned
exactly once and must not be reassigned later, in order to ensure data immutability. <br>
